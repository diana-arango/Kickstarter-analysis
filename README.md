# Kickstarter Challenge analysis

## Overview:
In module 1, we acquired a greater understanding of the Kickstarter data to help Louise with her project campaign named “Fever”. Different factors were reviewed to uncover any hidden trends and establish what made a crowdfunding project successful. The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate Louise’s campaigns performance in order to determine their proximity to their fundraising goals in correlation with their launch time and goals. Therefore, the data of their launch dates, their outcomes and funding goals are the foundation of the study

### Analysis and challenges:
For the analysis, it was required to apply conditional formatting to the outcomes data to classify the plays into successful, failure and cancelled without mentioning the need of filtering the dataset to “theater” as its parent category and “plays as “subcategory. A pivot table helped to summarize the plays performances yearly and subsequently monthly to help visualize the relationship between outcomes and launch months as a separate table outlined the performance of the projects based on their goals
 
A considerable number of projects started during the months of April to July. Projects run between April to May showed a better performance in comparison with the ones played during January and December. May was the best month to launch theater plays by having 66% of the projects successfully launched. Gradually the outcome declined during the months of July to September as less projects were presented. On the other hand, failed projects showed a similar performance, being May, the month when more projects were played and failed in comparison with other months. However, they didn’t exceed the amount of plays successfully launched

The correlation between the number of projects assigned to a specific goal didn’t conclude in a constant “win” factor. Projects assigned within a goal of less than $1000 to $9999 had a better chance of meeting their goals than projects with higher expectations. 85 % of the plays, have goals assigned between less than $ 1000 to $9999, from which 70 % met their goal,30 % didn’t; the other 15% were projects between $10000 to greater than $50000; those in general have a weak performance despite a few picks. 534 projects were expected to accomplish a goal from $1000 to $4999 from which 73% meet their goal, the projects included in a $5000 to 9999 bracket were also successful, leaving the door open to believe that if more projects were budged into a smaller goal bracket; they could be potentially more successful than the ones with higher dollar expectations. The chances of ending with failed or successful plays when their goals are among $ 35000 to $44999 are equally related. 67% could success as 33% might not. Projects over $45000 to $49999 are not profitable as projects greater than $50000 have 83% chances to fail https://github.com/diana-arango/Kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png

A challenge found on the project was to determine how long was a play run from its launch date to the date ended to determine the relationship between the length of a project, their outcomes and their goals expectations

### Results:
To conclude Louise will have more chances to succeed on her project if plays are run in summer, especially during May and June. December could be a risky month since almost half of the projects were a failure, but the other half succeed. September could be a second option for success but not with the same impact as May had. Ideally, Louise will see a positive return if the goals of their projects are set as less than $1000 to $4999 however if her expectations are higher than $45000, she is destined to fail. Data as of why the Kickstarter plays failed or were successful could help Louise to better support her decision to run the projects during a certain season if the seasons were a factor to outline during the analysis. Having a record of the length of each projects could assist Louise to compare the relationship between how long a play was run in days with their final outcome and goals to reach
